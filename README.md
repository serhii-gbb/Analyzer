# Analyzer

Web analyzer that help to search the same element on the page with 
minor changes! 

I recommend to use full jar file with all needed dependencies `Analyzer-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar` and launch him
according this pattern java -jar <jar_file> <target_file_path> <diff_file_path> <searching_id>
#
target_file and diff_file - required arguments 
#
searching_id - optional argument (if not specified, will be used default id = 'make-everything-ok-button')
